Audit ExampleCorp

At the end of this course, you will be doing a complete audit for a company called ExampleCorp. The project will involve:

1) Social Engineering
2) Open-source intelligence
3) Vulnerability assessment using automated tools
4) Manual auditing of systems and apps

The project won't be easy because it will test a lot of the skills you will be developing in this course including:

1) Chaining vulnerabilities together,
2) Modifying exploit code
3) Reading documentation to learn new tests

This project might sound challenging, now, but by the end of the course, you will be completely ready for it.

I think you'll be amazed by how much you learn.
