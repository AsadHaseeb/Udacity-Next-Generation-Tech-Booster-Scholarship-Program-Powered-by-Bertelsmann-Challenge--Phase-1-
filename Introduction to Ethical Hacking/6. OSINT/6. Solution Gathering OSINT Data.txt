Part I

Let's Mine Some Data!

I chose to do this exercise on Maltego Technologies.

Step 1. Find Associated Domains

To find the associated domains I:

1) Ran an internet search and the organization's website at maltego.com

2) Used the Find Associated Domains in One-Click tool on Pentest-Tool.com but did not find anything

3) Searched for the domain on Censys.io and found another domain - paterva.com

4) Recorded my findings in a spreadsheet

Step 2. Find Subdomains and Physical Locations

Next, I looked for any subdomains of maltego.com using FindSubDomain and added the listed subdomains to my spreadsheet.

Part II

Step 3: Find Hiring Requirements

I found information about job postings on the Careers page of maltego.com and added those to my spreadsheet.

Step 4: Find Events

I checked for events on the Maltego website but did not find any.

But I did find some helpful event information on LinkedIn and added that to my spreadsheet.

Step 5: Find Key Employees

LinkedIn was also a good source of information about key employees.
