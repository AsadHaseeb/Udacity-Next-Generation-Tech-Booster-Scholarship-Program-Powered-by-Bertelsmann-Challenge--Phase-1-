OSINT Is What Hackers Do In The Movies

If you have watched movies about hacking, you may have seen hackers using the internet to find every bit of information they need to attack the target.

In the real world, we use the internet too, but it typically doesn't provide enough information to be useful. So instead, we follow a more disciplined approach called Exploratory Link Analysis.

Exploratory Link Analysis is a three-step process:

1) Mining

Review the data and information we already have and try to gather more data based on what we have. This can include:

	1) The digital and physical infrastructure of the organization

	2) The employees and other people associated with the organization

	3) Information on operations, including events and announcements.

2) Build Links

Establish relationships between all the data gathered. We can create:

	1) Forward links that tell us how old information is related to new information

	2) Backward links that tell us how new information relates to the old source

3) Analyze

Examine the links and relationships we built

	1) Look at the importance and closeness of elements

	2) Create new information and develop conclusions

New Terms: 

Backward links: Connections from new information to an existing information source

Exploratory Link Analysis: A scientific approach to use OSINT to discover information leakage

Forward links: Connections from an existing information source to new information

Mining: The first step in Exploratory Link Analysis, which involves gathering information from various sources. Mining can be done on Infrastructure, Operations, and Employees.
