1) Add Entities in Maltego

To add the information I have gathered on Maltego, I opened Maltego on my Analyst machine and:

1) Created a new graph

2) Added a Company entity with a type of business organization that I named Maltego Technologies. NOTE: Maltego changes over time. If you don't see Company as an entity try Organization

3) Added maltego.com and paterva.com as a Domain entity

4) Added the subdomain information: courses.maltego.com, buy.maltego.com, and docs.maltego.com under *the Domain *entity

5) Added the location of the subdomains using a Location entity

6) Added URL entity for URL from where I found the information and named it Career Page.

7) Added a Company/Organization entity named RiskIQ

8) Added a Person identity with the information we gathered about the individuals we found

9) Added another URL entity with the URL where I found that information.

2) Build Forward Links

I added the following by dragging my mouse between entities:

2) A forward link from maltego.com to paterva.com named Shared SSL Certificate

3) A forward link from maltego.com to all the subdomains labeled Found by Subdomain Finder

4) Forward links from all the subdomains to their respective locations labeled Location of Server IP

5) A forward link from maltego.com to the Career Page domain labeled Found on the main website

6) A forward link from Career Page domain to the Munich location labeled Found this city on the job posts

8) A forward link from Recent Event to the RiskIQ company named About Us section of the Event

9) Forward links from Recent Event to the two people labeled About Us section of the Event

3) Create Backward Links

I used a similar process to create the following:

2) A backward link from Dirk Wagner to Maltego Technologies labeled Employee, SME

3) A backward link from Munich to Germany country labeled City in Germany

4) A backward link from Dirk Wagner to Germany labeled Lives in Germany

4) Run Transforms

To create more links, I used transforms:

	1) I right-clicked on the paterva.com entity to see all of the transforms available

	2) I ran transforms on DNS and Email addresses from the domain

5. Create a Collection

To reduce the data to a more manageable amount, I created a collection by clicking on the Collections tab of Maltego and selecting "3"

6. Add Notes

To remind myself what I did, I added a note on paterva.com stating "Data has been mined using Transforms"

I found a lot of data!

How many links did you find?
