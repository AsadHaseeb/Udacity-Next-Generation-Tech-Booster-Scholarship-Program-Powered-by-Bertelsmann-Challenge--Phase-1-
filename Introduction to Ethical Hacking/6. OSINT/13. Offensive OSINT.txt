The Criticality Issue

OSINT can be used for offensive operations, including going after hackers to uncover their identities when an organization is under a denial of service or a ransomware attack. However, this can be extremely dangerous.

Guidelines For Offensive OSINT

Offensive OSINT is always risky, but it will be more likely to succeed if you follow best practices. You should use:

1) Out-of-band communication: You should avoid regular communication channels that could be monitored or disrupted. Using a secret email address or emergency phone number makes it more difficult for the hacker to monitor communications.

2) Fake social media profiles: Social media providers often send notifications when a profile is viewed, so if you use your own account, the target may know that you are looking for them.

3) Passive information gathering channels: Avoid tools that send information like your IP address to the target. If you need to use a tool that doesn't support passive information gathering, use a VPN connection from another country to disguise your origin.

4) Need-to-know: Do not tell anyone about the analysis except the people you need to get data from to complete the analysis.

New Terms

Need-to-know: An information security principle where information is available to only those who need it. The existence of the information is often hidden from those who don't need the information.

Out-of-band communication: Communication done via covert, non-traditional, or unusual channels.

Passive information gathering: Information gathering where the analyst has no direct interaction with the target.
