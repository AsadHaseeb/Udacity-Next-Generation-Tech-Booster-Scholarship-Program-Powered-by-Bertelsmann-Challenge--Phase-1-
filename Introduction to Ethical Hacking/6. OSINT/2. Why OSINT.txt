Why Does OSINT Matter?

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

OSINT includes any publicly available information.

Some OSINT Is Available for Free

1) DNS records
2) Server and host information for websites
3) Government records
4) Addresses
5) Phone numbers

Some OSINT Is Available from Paid Sources

1) Premium APIs like VirusTotal are not free but are available to anyone who is willing to pay for it.

Since OSINT is available to everyone, the bad actors use this information too -- which is why an OSINT audit is critical for any organization.

Information Leakage

We leak information all the time without even knowing it. For example, if you post a picture of your team, you may inadvertently disclose information about the people you work with and your physical office building.

OSINT can help us identify what we are leaking
