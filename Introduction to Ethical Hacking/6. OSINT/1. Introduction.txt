Open Souce Intelligence

In this lesson, we will learn about OSINT, which stands for Open Source Intelligence. OSINT is a skill that defense, intelligence agencies, and the growing ethical hacking industry use to gather information about businesses.

There are four key areas of focus:

1) Exploratory Link Analysis
2) Data Mining
3) Establishing Links
4) Analyzing Links

We will finish this lesson with a small section on using OSINT in offensive operations and going after hackers to uncover their identities.

By the end of the lesson, you will be able to:

1) Mine and collect data about any target from sources including blogs, news media, social media posts, public records, and more

2) Establish links and relationships in the data you have collected

3) Analyze the links to discover new information and build conclusions about your target

That's what they do in the movies and, after this lesson, you'll know how to do it in real life.
