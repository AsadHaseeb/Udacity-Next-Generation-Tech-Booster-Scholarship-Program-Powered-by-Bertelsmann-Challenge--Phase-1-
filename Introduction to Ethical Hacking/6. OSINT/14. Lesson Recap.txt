What We Have Learned

In this lesson, we studied OSINT and focused on five topics:

Exploratory Link Analysis

We learned about the Exploratory Link Analysis process: about the Mine > Link > Analyze.

Data Mining

We looked at three categories of OSINT data: infrastructure, operations, and employees and how to mine data using the OSINT Framework.

Building Links

We learned how to establish links between the data we find using Maltego. With Maltego, we can manage the process and use Arrows, Collections, and Notes to establish the relationships.

Analyzing Links

We also learned how to analyze links using Tree, Universe, and Organic models to discover new information and build conclusions about the data we gathered.

Offensive OSINT

We ended this lesson with a discussion about using OSINT to target hackers to uncover their identities.

I hope you had as much fun learning this as I did teaching it!
