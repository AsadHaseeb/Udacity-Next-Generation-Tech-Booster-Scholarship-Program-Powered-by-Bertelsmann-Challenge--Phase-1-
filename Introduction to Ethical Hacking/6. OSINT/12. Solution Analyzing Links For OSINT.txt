How I Analyzed Links For OSINT
Here are the steps I took:

1. Analyze data using the Hierarchical Layout
When I click on Bob Smith

	1) The right arrow to Bob takes us to Paterva, whose original creator is Maltego
	2) The left arrow Bob takes us to Event on LinkedIn
	3) The event is linked to another person Alice Jones, who is a VP at Example Corp and related to Maltego.com

Analyzing the graph in the hierarchical layout shows that the authoritative and important entities are:

1) Maltego.com
2) Alice Jones
3) Event on Linkedin
4) Bob Smith
5) Maltego Technologies
6) Paterva
7) Maltego Tools

2. Analyze the data using the Circular Layout
In the middle circle, I found the same entities:

1) Maltego.com
2) Maltego Tools
3) Maltego Technologies
4) Event on Linkedin
5) Paterva.com
6) Paterva
7) Bob Smith

3. Analyze the data using the Organic Layout

I found three concentrations

1) Paterva.com
2) Maltego.com
3) A star-like shape at Bob Smith

I learned:

1) Maltego.com has shared an SSL certificate with Paterva.com
2) Paterva.com has an HTTP redirect to Maltego.com
3) Bob Smith is an employee of Maltego Technologies, and he was previously employed at Paterva
4) Paterva created the Maltego tool, but Maltego Technologies manages the Maltego tool
5) Maltego Technologies is in Germany, Bob Smith lives in Germany, and Paterva.com was also very active in Germany over the past few days

As a result of these observations, I concluded that either Paterva was bought by Maltego Technologies, or Paterva has been rebranded as Maltego Technologies.
