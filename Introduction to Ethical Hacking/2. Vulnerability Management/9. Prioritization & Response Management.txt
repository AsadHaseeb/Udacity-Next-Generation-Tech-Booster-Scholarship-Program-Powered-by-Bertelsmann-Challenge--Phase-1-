Prioritization And Response Management Is An Essential Skill:

What is Prioritization and Response Management?

1) Everything we scan, analyze, exploit, or report, goes into a central database or workspace.

2) We can include detailed information and any screenshots and analysis.

3) We use the workspace to manage our work, including closing vulnerabilities, reassigning tests, and accepting risks.

The Two Phases Of Prioritization And Response Management:

In the Create phase, we add the hosts, credentials, and vulnerabilities we have found.

When we add a vulnerability, we include the following:

	-> Description of the vulnerability.
	-> Impact on our CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability).
	-> Remediation Guidance.
	-> Technical details, including how to exploit.
	-> Supporting evidence (e.g. a screenshot or video).

In the Manage phase we:

	-> Create a risk rating.
	-> Confirm the vulnerability report.
	-> Determine effort needed to fix the vulnerability.
	-> Set up an action plan: retest, close the vulnerability, or accept the risk.
