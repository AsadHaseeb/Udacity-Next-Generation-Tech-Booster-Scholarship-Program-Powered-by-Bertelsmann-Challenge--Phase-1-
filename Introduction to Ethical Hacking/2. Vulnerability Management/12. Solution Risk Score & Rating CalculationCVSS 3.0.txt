This exercise involves following the four-step approach to assigning risk rating using CVSS.

Mapping The Base Score:

	1) Open NIST CVSS 3.0 Calculator: Common Vulnerability Scoring System Calculator(https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator)

	2) Find details about the exploited CVE (CVE-2019-0232): - NATIONAL VULNERABILITY DATABASE - CVE-2019-0232 Detail(https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-0232)

	3) Map the vector on the calculator: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Adjustments To the Temporal Score

	1) Exploit Code Maturity (E) should be set to Proof of Concept (P) because

	Exploit code is available but needs substantial modification

	2) Remediation Level (RL) should be marked as Official Fix (O) because

	The vendor has confirmed the vulnerability and has released a security update for the product

	3) Report Confirmation (RC) should be set to Not Defined (X) because we were not given any information about the confirmation of the report

	4) The final vector for the Temporal score is: CVSS3.0/E:P/RL:O/RC:X

Adjustments To the Environmental Score

	1) Attack Vector (MAV) should be changed to Adjacent Network (A) because > An attacker can only attack devices on the same network because of the presence of firewalls

	2) Confidentiality Impact (MC) should be set to None (N) because

	There is no loss of confidentiality during the attack

	3) Confidentiality Requirements (CR) should be set to High (H) because

	the affected system contains information that is critical to the organization

	4) Integrity Requirements should be set to Low (L) because

	The ability of the attacker to modify the files on the system is likely to have a limited impact on the organization

	5) Availability Requirements should also be set to Low (L) because

	Disruption of service is likely to have a limited impact on the day to day operations of the organization

	6) The final vector for the Environmental score is: CVSS3.0/MAV:A/MC:N/CR:H/IR:L/AR:L

Assign The Risk Rating:

1) The overall score after all the adjustments should be 4.3.

2) To check for the risk rating, open the relevant CVSS Specification (opens in a new tab)document and check the Qualitative Servierity Risk Ratings to find that a score of 4.3 falls is considered Medium Risk.
