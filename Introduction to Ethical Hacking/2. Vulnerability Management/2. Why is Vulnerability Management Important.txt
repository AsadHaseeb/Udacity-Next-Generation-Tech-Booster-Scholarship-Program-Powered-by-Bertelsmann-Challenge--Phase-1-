To hack a system, you need three things:
	A vulnerability(Weakness)
	An exploit to trigger that vulnerability(Advantage)
	An interface between you and the affected target(Interface)

There will be cases where you have a vulnerability but no exploit against it. There will even be cases where you have both but no way to interact with the target. If there is no attack surface, there is just no attack!

Whether it is ethical hacking, penetration testing, blue teaming, or anything else, our goal with information security is to reduce the attack surface as much as possible. This can only happen with a rock-solid vulnerability management program.

New Terms

Attack Surface: Any physical or digital part of a system that an attacker can access

Exploit: Anything that can take advantage of a weakness, usually a piece of code or malware

Vulnerability: A weakness in the system
