We can follow a four-step process that aligns with international standards and practices used by top organizations:

The Four Steps To Enlightenment:

	1) Discovery
	2) Testing
	3) Prioritization
	4) Response

1) Discovery:

	-> Assets that may require vulnerability testing are identified.
	-> This is typically done by the IT department.
	-> Information about the assets is stored in a CMDB (Configuration Management Database).

2) Testing(Reporting):

	-> Both automated and manual tests are performed.
	-> All findings are reported for further analysis.

3) Prioritization:

	-> Findings from the previous phase are analyzed and risk scores are calculated.
	-> The outcome is a risk profile defined by a rating level like Low, Medium, High, or Critical.

4) Response:

	-> Multiple teams, including Governance Risk Compliance, Patch Management, and Systems Engineering get involved.
	-> Management decides whether to accept the risks or to mitigate them.
	All decisions are documented.
