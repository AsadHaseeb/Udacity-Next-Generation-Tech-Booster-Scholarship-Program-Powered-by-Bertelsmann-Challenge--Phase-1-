The False Positive & Negative Problem

False Positive and False Negatives

A machine can never replace human judgment and thatâ€™s why we use these scanners only as a visibility tool to focus our energy and resources.

	1) There will be cases when a scanner will show a vulnerability, but the vulnerability doesn't exist or has been fixed by an update. We call that a false positive.

	2) There will be cases where the scanner misses a vulnerability because it doesn't have enough information to see the vulnerability. We call that a false negative.

Scanners Can't Do Vulnerability Chaining:

Sometimes you'll need to combine vulnerabilities together to gain access to a system for example, when one vulnerability gives you access to valid credentials and a second vulnerability gives you an opening to use those credentials.

In this case, a scanner should detect the two vulnerabilities separately, but it won't recognize the level of threat because neither vulnerability is enough to compromise the system on its own. The automated scanner can't make the logical leap to understand how they can be used together to compromise the system.

Finding Chained vulnerabilities is one of the reasons why we still need to do manual auditing and apply human judgment.

You'll learn more about that in the next lesson which covers manual system auditing.

New Terms

False Negative: When a scanner misses a vulnerability

False Positive: When a scanner reports a vulnerability that doesn't exist

Vulnerability Chaining: When one or more vulnerability are used together to compromise a system
