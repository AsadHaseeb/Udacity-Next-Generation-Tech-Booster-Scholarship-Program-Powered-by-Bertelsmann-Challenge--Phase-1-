There are many international standards for risk management like NIST RMF, ISO 27005, etc., But none of them is specialized for vulnerability risk scoring. Instead, they are general standards.

CVSS, the common vulnerability scoring system, was created to provide a hybrid approach that allows subjective as well as objective elements to calculate the risk scores.

Most organizations use CVSS 3.0 due to its wide acceptability among product vendors as they are the ones who provide the technical information used to calculate risk.

There are three types of scores under CVSS 3.0:

1) Base score
2) Temporal score
3) Environmental score

Base Score:

Generally provided by the vendor of the product or a reputable risk rating agency. There are eight parameters:

1) Attack Vector
2) Attack Complexity
3) Privileges Required
4) User Interaction
5) Scope
6) Confidentiality Impact
7) Integrity Impact
8) Availability Impact

Temporal and Environmental Adjustments:

Temporal Score:

Adjustments that are related to time-specific variables. There are three parameters:

	1) Exploit Code Maturity
	2) Remediation Level
	3) Report Confidence

Environmental Score:

Adjustments that are related to your environment. There are 11 parameters -- eight are the same as the Base Score parameters plus three more:

	1) Eight Base Score parameters
	2) Confidentiality requirements
	3) Integrity requirements
	4) Availability requirements

An overall CVSS score is derived after adjusting all three scores. This is used to assign the risk rating based on the CVSS Specifications Document(https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.0/specification-document).

Using The CVSS Calculator: 

Scenario:

During a Nessus Scan, we found that our Windows Servers are affected by CVE-2017-0144. A security analyst manually validated the vulnerablity and reported the following:

	1) An exploit code is available which works in all situations
	2) The exploit code requires a one-line modification to work in our environment
	3) Microsoft has already released a security update for the product.
	4) There are firewalls in our network so the vulnerability can only be exploited by an attacker on the same network segment.

Our goal is to assign a Risk Rating using CVSS 3.0.

Step 1: Map The Base Score
	1) Open the NIST CVSS Calculator(https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator) and choose version 3.0.

	2) Find the base score in the Risk Information section of the Nessus page for the vulnerability. Or you can research it manually using the National Vulnerability Database (NVD)(https://nvd.nist.gov/). For CVE-2017-0144(https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-0144) the attack vector is: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

	3) Update the Base Score Metrics to match the vector.

Step 2: Make Adjustments To the Temporal Score

	1) The Exploit Code Maturity (E) should be set to Functional (F) because

	Exploit code is available and only requires modifying one line.

	2) The Remediation Level (RL) should be marked as Official Fix (O) because

	The vendor (Microsoft) has already released a security update for the product

	3) The Report Confirmation (RC) should be set to Confirmed (C) because

	An analyst in our team has confirmed the exploitability of the vulnerability

	4) The final vector for the Temporal score is: CVSS3.0/E:F/RL:O/RC:C

Adjustments To the Environmental Score:

	1) The Attack Vector (MAV) should be changed to Adjacent Network (A) because

	An attacker can only attack devices on the same network because of the presence of firewalls

	2) The Confidentiality Requirements (CR), Integrity Requirements (IR). Availability Requirements (IR) should be set to High (H) because

	it is given to us as per the information security objectives of the organization.

	3) The final vector for the Environmental score is: CVSS:3.0/MAV:A/CR:H/IR:H/AR:H

Assign The Risk Rating:

	1) The overall score after all the adjustments should be 7.0

	2) To check for the risk rating, open the relevant CVSS Specification (https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.0/specification-document)document and check the Qualitative Servierity Risk Ratings to find that a score of 7.0 falls is considered High Risk.

New Terms:

Objective: An element that is evaluated strictly on evidence; no judgment is required.

Subjective: An element that requires judgment to evaluate and may be influenced by emotions or biases.
