In this lesson, We studied vulnerability management and focused on four topics:

Vulnerability Scanning:

We learned about automated, and manual tests. We focused on using automated tools and learned about policy creation and scan scheduling.

Prioritization & Response Management:

We learned how to create new entries. import data from the scanner to our workspace and manage it accordingly. We also looked at other tasks including closing the vulnerability and accepting risks.

Risk Score & Rating Calculation:

We learned how to calculate risk using the CVSS calculator. We learned about the base score, the temporal score, and the environmental score. We looked at the CVSS vector and how to include that in the calculator.

False Results:

We ended this lesson with a discussion about false positives and false negatives and why manual testing is really important.

In The Next Lesson, We Will Focus On System Auditing:

1) Information Gathering
2) Researching Vulnerabilities
3) Researching Exploits
4) Executing Exploits
5) Reporting
6) Buggy Exploits
