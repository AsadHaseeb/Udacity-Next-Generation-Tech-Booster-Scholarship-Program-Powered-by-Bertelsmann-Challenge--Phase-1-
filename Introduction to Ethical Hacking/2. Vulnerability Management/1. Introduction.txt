Openings weaken systems, and these weaknesses are called vulnerabilities. This lesson marks the start of our journey, where we will focus on vulnerability management. There are three key areas of focus:

	1) Vulnerability Scanning
	2) Prioritization and Response
	3) Risk Scoring

We will finish this lesson with a small discussion on something I call The Game of False Results.

By the end of the lesson, you will be able to:

	1) Configure custom policies and manage automated scans
	2) Calculate risk scores and assign ratings
	3) Use prioritization and response management tools to target response efforts
