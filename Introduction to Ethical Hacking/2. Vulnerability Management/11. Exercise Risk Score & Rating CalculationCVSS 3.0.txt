Applying CVSS Vulnerability Scoring

One of the analysts in your team has finished manual testing on an Apache Tomcat Server.

Your task is to find the risk score, and assign a risk rating on the basis of the following:

	1) The CVE exploited was CVE-2019-0232

	2) Exploit code is available but needs substantial modification before execution

	3) The vendor has confirmed the vulnerability and has released a security update for the product

	4) An attacker can only attack devices on the same network because of the presence of firewalls

	5) There is no loss of confidentiality during the attack but the affected system contains information that is critical to the organization

	6) The ability of the attacker to modify the files on the system is likely to have a limited impact on the organization

	7) Disruption of service is likely to have a limited impact on the day to day operations of the organization

Note: Our organization uses CVSS 3.0 Specification
