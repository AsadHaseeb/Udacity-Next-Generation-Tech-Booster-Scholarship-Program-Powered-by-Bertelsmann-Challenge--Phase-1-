The Testing Phase of Vulnerability Management:

Scans:

	-> Scans can be manual or automated.
	-> A manual audit provides better results, but the testing can be complicated.
	-> Automated testing helps to establish a base for a deeper manual testing.

Scanning Process:

To scan for vulnerabilities, we need a scan policy. These policies can be thought of as templates to put our asset details that we want to scan.

Configure a Policy Template:

Templates can be pre-built or user-defined. They should include:

	-> How to run the tests.
	-> Which tests to run.
	-> An option to use credentials.

Configure a Scan:

The scan should include:

	-> The IP Address of a machine or URL of a web application.
	-> A scan schedule (daily, weekly, monthly or specific dates).
	-> A scan time (try to avoid network congestion).

Tools For Automated Scans

There are many tools, including:

1) Nessus(https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus)
2) Saint(https://my.saintcorporation.com/resources/documentation/help/saint9_help/introduction.html)
3) Qualys(https://www.qualys.com/)
4) Burp(https://portswigger.net/burp/enterprise)

We will use Nessus for this course, but all of these tools have the same basic functionality. Once you understand how to do an automated scan with Nessus, you will be able to quickly adapt to any of the other tools.
