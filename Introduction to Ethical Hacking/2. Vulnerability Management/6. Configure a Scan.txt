Configuring A Scan Policy

The target IP address is mentioned as 10.10.10.20 in the video, but while experimenting you will consider the Testlab VM with IP address - 10.10.10.15.

There are two types of scan policies -- pre-built and user-defined. An organization typically creates user-defined templates for specific machines and apps by customizing pre-built templates and the Ethical Hacker translates the scan policy into a Nessus implementation.

Important: You need to wait until Nessus downloads and installs all plugins and components, before you can create any policies.

Example Scan Policy:

Policy Template - Policy_EH_C1_SN0
Nessus Essentials Daily Scan

	-> Do not ping the host(s)
	-> Scanning Fragile Devices is not allowed
	-> Scan all ports
	-> Do not use Local Enumerators
	-> Scan over TCP
	-> No SSL Scanning
	-> Scans To Be Done - All

Configure a Scan Policy In Nessus:

1) In the Policies tab of the Nessus Dashboard, click on the New Policy button

2) Choose Advanced Scan

3) In the Basic Settings tab enter a Name and Description

4) Check the settings in the Host Discovery tab of the Discovery Settings For this scan, the policy instructs us to:

	-> disable the Ping the remote host button.
	-> uncheck all of the boxes in the Fragile Devices section

5) Check the settings in the Port Scanning tab of the Discovery Settings For this scan, the policy instructs us to:

	-> change the value of the Port scan range from default to all
	-> disable all the Local Port Enumerators by unchecking the boxes
	check the TCP box and uncheck SYN and UDP in the Network Port Scanners section

6) Check the settings in the Service Discovery tab of the Discovery Settings For this scan, the policy instructs us to disable Search for SSL/TLS/DTLS services

7) Click the Save button

Using Policies To Scan: 

Configure a Scan: 

1) Click on New Scan in the My Scans tab
2) In the User Defined tab select a policy -- Policy_EH_C1_SN0
3) In the Targets section of the Basic General Settings enter the IP Address -- 10.10.10.15. The target is the Testlab VM with IP address - 10.10.10.15.
4) In the Schedule tab: 

	-> Enable the schedule
	-> Set the frequency -- Daily
	-> Set the time -- 00:00
	-> Set the Timezone

5) Click on the Save button

Manually Launch a Scan: 

You can manually launch a scheduled scan by clicking on the launch button.

Scan Results: 

When the scan is complete, you will see a list of vulnerabilities rated from Low to Critical. Click on a vulnerability to see details, including:

	-> A description of the vulnerability
	-> Remediation guidance
	-> References to other sources
	-> Risk Score
	-> Exploit availability
	-> Other technical details

Reports and Exports:

Some scanners also allow you to download a report in formats like HTML, CSV, or PDF and create customized reports.

Most scanners allow you to export the scan results for reuse in other tools. In Nessus, go to Export > Nessus to get a file with a .nessus extension.
