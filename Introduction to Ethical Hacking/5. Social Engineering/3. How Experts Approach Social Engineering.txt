Secrets Of Social Engineering

Social Engineering is About Understanding Psychology and Human Emotions

Social Engineering is not about terms like phishing, vishing, dumpster diving, tailgating, etc.

There are Five Opportunities In Human Psychology:

1) Greed influences emotions as well as logic. People want to possess things that they donâ€™t need.

2) Fear can occur when people worry about the future or when people start focusing on regrets.

3) Urgency makes people panic and take action.

4) Curiosity is the continual desire to discover and investigate new things.

5) Helpfulness is an opportunity that enables teamwork and supporting one another for a greater good or larger purpose.

These are the five fundamental opportunities that a good social engineer needs to understand and take advantage of.

New Terms

Dumpster Diving: A social engineering technique where the attacker looks for potentially valuable information in the organization's trash cans or dumpsters

Phishing: A social engineering attack where the attacker sends an email to the target to influence their actions to gain access or sensitive information

Tailgating: A social engineering technique where the attacker closely follows a target to gain access to a restricted area. For example, when the target uses a key card to open a door, the attacker enters the room before the door closes.

Vishing: A social engineering attack where the attacker calls the target to influence their actions to gain access or sensitive information
