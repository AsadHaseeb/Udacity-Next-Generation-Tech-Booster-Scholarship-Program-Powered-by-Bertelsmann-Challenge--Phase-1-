Why Does Social Engineering Matter?

People Are The Weak Link!

Most systems in the modern world rely on both technology and people.

When everything is configured properly and is patched regularly, technology is very reliable. Machines and devices rarely make mistakes.

On the other hand, people can make mistakes all the time! Security breaches often occur when a bad actor takes advantage of human mistakes.

Social Engineering Can Help Ethical Hackers

An Ethical Hacker can use social engineering to:

1) Access credentials required for exploits: Your system may have a vulnerability where the exploits require valid credentials, ranging from low-level standard user privileges or high-level admin privileges.

2) Influence a user to take an action: Some types of attacks will only work when a user interacts with the system by turning off a machine, clicking on a link, or opening a file.

In both of these situations, we can use social engineering to influence the user to give us the access we need.
