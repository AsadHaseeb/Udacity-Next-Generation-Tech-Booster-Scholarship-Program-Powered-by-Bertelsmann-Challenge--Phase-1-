Creating A Persuasive Landing Page

1. Update the Document Title

A document title is not an element visible on the page but is visible on the browser tab itself. It is a good idea to customize this otherwise the page will say index.html.

<title>Grow Your Career</title>

2. Add a Bold Headline
You need a bold headline that attracts the audience you are targeting. In this example, the words "Instant Promotion" will attract the attention of people who want a promotion.

<h1 style="color: white;">How To Get An <u>INSTANT PROMOTION?</u></h1>

3. Write a Subheading Focused on the Benefit

Your subheading should focus on a benefit or result. In this example, the possibility of a reduced workload is the benefit that the target will get if they continue to read the page.

<h2 style="color: white;">While Working <u>EVEN LESSER</u> Than You Do Right Now!</h2>

4. Include an Interesting Video

Attention spans are limited but a video can both hold the target's attention and build trust. In this example, I used a YouTube video where I explain the infosec career ladder.

5. Add Attractive Images

Not everyone will watch the video, but interesting images will help keep them reading the page. In this example, the base template has three placeholders in the images folder which I replaced with the following images.

Car - https://pixabay.com/illustrations/car-vehicle-sports-car-racing-car-49278/

House - https://pixabay.com/illustrations/house-cottage-brick-brick-house-4826263

Money - https://pixabay.com/illustrations/dollars-coins-money-currency-517113/

6. Write Persuasive Text

Keep the text short and focused on the benefits. Use bullet points whenever possible. In this example, I included reasons:

1) Discover a perfect strategy for your next promotion
2) Understand what your next HR is looking for
3) Talk through seven successful lifestyle changes
4) Uncover the secrets of 10X growth formulae
5) Get ready for the millionaire mindset
6) It is absolutely free!!!

7. Include Testimonials for Social Proof

Social Proof helps the target to overcome any fear they have by showing what other people are saying. Good social proof can put a lot of pressure on the target to say "yes" to what the website is offering. In my example, I used three fake testimonials:

1) Talking to Sagar was totally awesome! I have much better clarity in my life, a big thanks!

2) It's been a few months since I met Sagar, and I take pleasure in recommending this insane offer!

3) An incredible ecosystem where I got what I wanted and we helped each other as well. Highly Recommended!

8. End With a Call To Action

By the time the target gets to the bottom of the page, they should be fully convinced to take action. In this example, I used the tel: attribute in the anchor tag to open the dialer app on the target's phone when the button is clicked. The phone number is preloaded, which increases the possibility of a successful attack.

<a href="tel:+19876543210"><button> GET YOUR FREE CONSULTATION NOW </button></a>
