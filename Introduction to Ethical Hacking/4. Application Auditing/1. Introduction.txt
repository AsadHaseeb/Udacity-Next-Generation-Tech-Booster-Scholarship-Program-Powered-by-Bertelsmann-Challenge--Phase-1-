Application Auditing

In this lesson, we will be looking at web application auditing. We will focus on:

	-> OWASP WSTG
	-> Request and Response
	-> Semi-Automated Tools
	-> Fully Automated Tools

We will finish this lesson by discussing the vast array of devices that can and should be audited and some best practices for keeping up in this rapidly evolving field.

By the end of the lesson, you will be able to:

	->Send requests to a web application and analyze the response that comes back
	-> Test web applications using OWASP WSTG
	-> Use semi-automated and fully automated tools
