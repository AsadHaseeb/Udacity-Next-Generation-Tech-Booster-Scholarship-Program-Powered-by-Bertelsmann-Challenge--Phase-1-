Using Request And Response:

Your target for this exercise is the configuration database file of the SBVA virtual machine which is located at http://sbva.local/includes/config.db

Your goal is to complete two tasks:

1) Modify the contents of the config file using a PUT request

2) Delete the configuration file using a DELETE request

You can use curl to make both requests. As a reminder, the basic usage syntax for curl is:

-> curl -X <request method> <target> <options>

To determine the exact curl statement to use, you may need to do further research. Here are two suggestions

1) Run a curl -h command in your terminal to pull up the curl help menu

2) Search the internet search for the type of command you want to run
