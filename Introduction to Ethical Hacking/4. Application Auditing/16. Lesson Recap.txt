What We Have Learned:

In this lesson, we learned about web application auditing and focused on five topics:

OWASP WSTG:

We learned about the OWASP Web Security Testing Guide and explored all 11 categories of web application tests. We also learned how to use the guide to perform specific tests.

Request and Response:

We looked at HTTP Request methods like GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEADand OPTIONS. We also explored response codes and learned how to use curl to send requests.

Semi-Automated Tools:

We discovered how using semi-automated tools can reduce the workload and increase the efficiency of the testing process. We used a tool called Burp Suite to perform a brute force attack on a websiteâ€™s login page.

Fully Automated Tools:

We also learned why a semi-automated tool may not be enough and how to use fully automated tools to perform specific tests related to vulnerabilities, functions, and products.

So Many Things To Hack!

We ended this lesson with a discussion about other things that can be hacked. We learned that each type of device requires a different methodology, which is why continuous learning is so important in this industry.

In The Next Lesson, We Will Focus On:

1) Five Opportunities In Human Psychology
2) Phishing Simulations
3) Creating Malware
4) Landing Page For SE
5) Ethics of SE
