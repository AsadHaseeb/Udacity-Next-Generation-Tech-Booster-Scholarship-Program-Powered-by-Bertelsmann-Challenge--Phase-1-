Learning About The Test

Getting Started:

1) Find the page for WSTG-INPV-02 (Testing for Stored Cross Site Scripting) on OWASP WSTG 4.1(https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/02-Testing_for_Stored_Cross_Site_Scripting.html)

2) Review the Test Summary

3) Review Black-Box Testing in the How to Test section

4) Explore the sbva.local application to find a page with an input form as required by the black-box testing approach. http://sbva.local/create.php seems to be a perfect candidate for testing XSS because it is storing user inputs and also rendering them as HTML code in a table displayed on the home page.

Testing For XSS:

Running The Test:

1) Copy the first payload from **the Testing for Stored XSS **section under the Black-Box Testing approach.

2) Browse to http://sbva.local and click on the Rate Us button to open a form with input fields.

aaa@aa.com&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;

3) Paste the copied payload into the form and submit.

It does not work!

4) Try again with the second payload in WSTG-INPV-02

aaa@aa.com%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C%2Fscript%3E

It still does not work!

Troubleshooting:

Don't worry if your troubleshooting steps didn't work and you weren't able to demonstrate the XSS vulnerability. This was a difficult challenge! But do notice the importance of persistence. Don't give up too easily!

1) Use the portion of the payload starting from the script tag in the name and message field.

<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

Two alerts are generated with the web session cookie value.


2) To ensure that both of the fields are vulnerable, replace document.cookie with 1 and 2 respectively for the name and message fields.

<script>alert(1)</script>
<script>alert(2)</script>

Two alerts are generated with the value 1 and 2 confirming that both fields are vulnerable
