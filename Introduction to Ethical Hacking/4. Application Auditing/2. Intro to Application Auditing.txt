Why Is Application Auditing Important?

Web applications are a huge part of any organization's infrastructure, so it is critical to audit their security.

How Is Application Auditing Different From Systems Auditing?

Auditing web apps is different from auditing systems because we need to look for vulnerabilities in the code and deployment instead of looking at services and ports.

OWASP Web Security Testing Guide:

The OWASP Web Security Testing Guide(https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/) provides critical guidance for testing web applications. OWASP WSTG 4.1 includes more than one hundred tests in eleven categories.

WSTG Categories:

1) Information Gathering(https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/01-Information_Gathering/README.html): similar to the reconnaissance phase of system testing

2) Configuration and Deployment Management Testing(https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/02-Configuration_and_Deployment_Management_Testing/README.html): related to securely configuring and deploying the web app on the internet

3) Identity Management Testing(https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/03-Identity_Management_Testing/README.html): tests for usernames and user registration.

4) Authentication Testing(https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Authentication_Testing/README.html): tests related passwords and other authentication mechanisms

More WSTG Categories:

1) Authorization Testing(https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/05-Authorization_Testing/README.html): tests related to the access level of the user.

2) Session Management Testing(https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/README.html): how the web app manages a user login session.

3) Input Validation Testing(https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/README.html): tests related to user input and validation on the web application and server

4) Testing for Error Handling(https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/08-Testing_for_Error_Handling/README.html): deals with the web application’s behavior when an error occurs

5) Testing for Weak Cryptography(https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/09-Testing_for_Weak_Cryptography/README.html): looks at encryption and hashing algorithms for data storage and transit

6) Business Logic Testing(https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/10-Business_Logic_Testing/README.html): considers how the app reacts in both typical situations and edge cases when users do something unexpected or unusual

7) Client-Side Testing(https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/11-Client_Side_Testing/README.html): tests the application against attacks where server-side processing isn't required
