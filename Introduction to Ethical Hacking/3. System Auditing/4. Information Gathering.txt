Using A Target Database:

The goal of reconnaissance is to collect and store information in an organized manner. We collect information about our target including:

	-> Open ports
	-> Services running
	-> Service version numbers
	-> Operating system being used

We organize and store this information in a target database

Elements of Target Database:

1) Generally, the IP Address or the URL of the target is listed under the column HOST

2) Opened ports on the target are listed under the column PORT

3) Protocols of the opened ports are listed under the column PROTO

4) Services running on those ports are listed under the column SERVICE

5) Versions of those services found are listed under the column VERSION

6) Additional Information can be stored under the column COMMENTS

Simple Target Database - Pen and Paper

We could just write down all of the information using a pen and paper, but that would be very time consuming, and as the list gets longer, it would be difficult to keep organized.

Better Target Database - Spreadsheet

A better option is to use a simple spreadsheet as our target database. We can create a row for each bit of information and columns to store each type of data.

Professional Target Database - Specialized Tool

Professionals often use specialized tools including Metasploit, Core-Impact, and others that make it easier to set up and manage the database.
