Executing Public Exploits:

Process For Executing A Public Exploit:

1) Modify the exploit according to your needs (eg: LHOST, LPORT, RHOST, RPORT)

2) Compile the raw code into an executable file

3) Debug the code by looking after the errors and dependency issues

4) Run the exploit on the target

Steps To Compile A Public Exploit:

Target Machine - 10.10.10.15 (You should practice this hence we are doing it on your test lab)

Download the exploit code in your Attacker Machine - exp.c(https://udacity-ehnd.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Ethical+Hacker/exp.c)

1) Open the exploit in a text editor and read it. (There is a comment on top which tells us how to compile it)

2) Compile the exploit using gcc with the command gcc -o exp exp.c -lcrypto

3) Depending on your machine, you might get an error, just like in the video. You should get multiple warning messages because some parts of the exploit are deprecated, but the exploit will still compile and work!

Steps To Execute The Compiled Exploit:

1) Run the exploit using ./exp

2) Exploit requires additional information. Usage shown to us is ./exp target box [port] [-c N] where the target and port are to be selected using the information in the target database. In our environment, it is.

./exp 0x6b 10.10.10.15 443 -c 50

3) Exploit takes quite some time to spawn a fully-rooted shell. Confirm the hack by running the command hostname and the output should be testlab.example.com

New Terms:

Compiler: Software that converts source code into an executable file

Listening Host (LHOST): The IP Address of the machine where a listener is running

Listening Port (LPORT): The open port on the machine where a listener is running

Payload: The malicious code that infects a target system

Remote Host (RHOST): The target's IP Address

Remote Port (RPORT): The open port on the target's machine
