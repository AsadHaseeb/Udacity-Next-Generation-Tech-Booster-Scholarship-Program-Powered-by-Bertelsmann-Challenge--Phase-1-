Researching Vulnerabilities:

The job of an Ethical Hacker is to find known vulnerabilities as they have the highest chances of being exploited. A Common Vulnerability Exposure (CVE) is assigned by organizations to products affected globally.

Important Elements of CVE:

1) Vulnerability Description: brief information about the vulnerability

2) CVSS Vector: base and temporal score related information

3) Products Affected: all of the affected products by the vulnerability

4) Vulnerability Type: type of weakness

Type Of Vulnerabilities:

1) Denial of Service (DOS) is a vulnerability that affects the availability of the system by crashing the services or applications, stopping processes, or increasing the system's workload.

2) Execution (EXEC) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to run running a command or code on the system.

3) Memory Corruption/Overflows (MC/BO) generally occur due to improper handling of resources. These can indirectly affect CIA by leaving the system vulnerable to DOS or code execution attacks.

4) Application-based vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, SQLI, etc. (We will study these in the next lesson)

Researching Exploits:

Researching Exploits Is An Important Skill

You cannot take advantage of a vulnerability if there is no exploit against it.

Three Types Of Exploit Codes:

1) Proof of concept / Analysis of vulnerability refers to incomplete exploits. These are often long and detailed articles describing the vulnerability. These can be used by experienced exploit writers to develop an exploit from scratch. They can also be used by an Ethical Hacker to manually send requests and execute the exploit in a step-by-step process.

2) Public Exploits are community-driven and can be risky to use. They are typically shared as raw code that will need to be modified to work in the target environment.

3) Commercial Exploits are developed by a reputable vendor. The vendors do a significant amount of research and testing in multiple environments so they are considered quite safe. A vendor may also be able to provide exact metrics on how the exploit can affect the CIA (Confidentiality, Availability, and Integrity) of the target system.
