Why Does System Auditing Matter?

Automated Testing Is Not Enough

	An automated scan may lead to false positives, false negatives, or both! That is why a manual system audit is necessary.

Manual Validation Can Improve Accuracy

1) False Positives - We take all the findings of automated scans and test them one by one. We find the exploits and try to run them and see if the vulnerability actually exists

2) False Negative - Retesting for missing items can help us avoid false negatives. Here we look for things that the automated scanner can miss, like the possibility of a chained vulnerability.

Security Auditing Is Not an Art, It's a Science:

Most organizations use a four-phase methodology for system auditing.

Four Phases of System Auditing:

1) Reconnaissance - Gathering information about the target
2) Research - Finding known vulnerabilities and exploits on our target
3) Validation - Modifying the exploit code to validate vulnerabilities
4) Reporting - Writing a report to share the results of the audit

New Terms:

Reconnaissance: Gathering information about the target
Reporting: Sharing the results of an audit
Research: Finding known vulnerabilities and exploits
Validation: Using exploit code to confirm that a vulnerability exists

This article shares a similar framework for system auditing: What Are the Penetration Testing Steps?(https://kirkpatrickprice.com/blog/7-stages-of-penetration-testing/). It describes a seven-step process that is similar to the four-step framework described above but splits the first phase into three parts and the last phase into two.
