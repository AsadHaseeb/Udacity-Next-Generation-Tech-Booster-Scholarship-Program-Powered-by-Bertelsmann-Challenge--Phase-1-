What We Have Learned:

In this lesson, we studied System Auditing and focused on six topics:

Test Scopes:

We learned about test scopes and how to use them while conducting a manual audit

Information Gathering:

We learned how to gather information and organize it in target databases using NMap and the Metasploit Framework.

Researching Vulnerabilities & Exploits:

We learned how to use the information we gathered to research vulnerabilities and exploits. We used CVEâ€™s to find and understand vulnerabilities and we looked at Proof of Concept, public and commercial exploits.

Executing Exploits:

We learned how to execute exploits and how the process for executing public exploits is different from commercial exploits.

Report Writing:

We learned how to use all the information we have collected to write effective reports.

Discussion On Buggy Exploits:

We ended this lesson with a discussion about why exploit writers often include intentional bugs in their exploit code so only a person who understands the exploit can fix and use the exploit.

In The Next Lesson, We Will Focus On:

	-> OWASP WSTG
	-> Request and Response
	-> Semi-Automated Tools
	-> Fully Automated Tools

So Many Things To Hack!
