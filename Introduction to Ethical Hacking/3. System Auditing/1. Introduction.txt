We have done a lot already with automated scanning but now itâ€™s time to do some manual testing. This lesson will cover System Auditing. There are five key areas of focus:

	1) Test Scope
	2) Information Gathering
	3) Researching Vulnerabilities & Exploits
	4) Executing Exploits
	5) Report Writing

We will finish this lesson with a small discussion on why some exploits are intentionally written with bugs in the exploit code

By the end of the lesson, you will be able to:

	1) Interpret the test scope document for audit
	2) Gather and organize information about a target
	3) Do vulnerability and exploit research
	4) Execute exploit codes
	5) Write industry-standard reports
