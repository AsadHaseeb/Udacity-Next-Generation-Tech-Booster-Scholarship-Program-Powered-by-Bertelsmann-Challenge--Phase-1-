Exploiting CVE-2003-0201:

In the last exercise, we found that Samba 2.2.1a is vulnerable against CVE-2003-0201 and we found an exploit named Trans2Open Overflow.

For this exercise, we need to validate the vulnerability using Metasploit on your analyst machine. Be aware that:

1) The rules of assessment only allow the use of commercial exploits

2) A firewall is running on the system which only allows outbound connections to NTP (Network Time Protocol) servers on TCP
