Finding 1: Remote Buffer Overflow – CRITICAL

Vulnerability Description:

Buffer overflow in the call_trans2open function in trans2.c for Samba 2.2.x before 2.2.8a, 2.0.10 and earlier 2.0.x versions, and Samba-TNG before 0.3.2, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

Exposure/Analysis:

The target is running this service as the Root User hence this is extremely dangerous. If exploited successfully, will give complete privileged control over the server.

It should be noted that the default Meterpreter payload doen’t works and needs to be changed to a generic shell payload for the exploit to work successfully.

Recommendations:

Upgrade Samba to a secure release – Latest version available is Samba 4.13.x
